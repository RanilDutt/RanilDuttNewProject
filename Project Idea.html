        <h4 class="card-title">Project Overview</h4>
        <p class="card-text">The four major types of cancer that take lives of our Australian people are Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Bowel Cancer and Skin Cancer. To save lives there are preventative measures place by our state and territory governments for Breast Cancer, Bowel Cancer and Skin Cancer where people are remaindered to go and do their regular screening test so that cancer can be dedicated at a earlier stage which is more treatable and that saves lives. However for prostate cancer there are no measures are placed yet where Men of Australia can get this tested on a regular basis and get a reminder to go and get the test done.
		An ideal project idea here is to develop an application that will send a reminder letter encouraging our men to do the test on a regular basis for Prostate Cancer. I am not a clinician so for our project purpose business requirements we say it will be every 2 years.
        </p>
        <h4 class="card-title">Motivation</h4>
        <p class="card-text">This project will be both interesting and useful. This idea will open a can warms in IT as it will discover more areas of IT and really is up to the developer to where this can go.
		According to Cancer Australia Estimated number of new cancer cases diagnosed in 2019 is 144713 and out of this total of 78081 are males and 66632 are females. Estimated number of deaths from cancer in 2019 is 49,896 and out of this total of 28,070 males and 21,826 are females.
		Further to this if the cancer is broken down into different types of cancer, Prostate Cancer came second on the list at just under 20000 new cases were found in just one year of 2019. I am passionate about saving lives and the new project application can change the numbers and if it saves only one person that means something right.

        <h4 class="card-title">Project Description</h4>
        <p class="card-text">The new application that will service all our state and territories will be called (PSAR) Prostate Screen Australia Registry. Where clients will be invited to register the program and in return the system will generate a reminder letter for the Prostate Cancer test. For our project purpose we will be inviting clients that are age of 50 years plus. There can be multiple scenarios that can be used here but for start we are going to use two: Entry Point – new clients and Current Client – existing clients
        </p>
		<p class="card-text">
		Entry Point: This is how we will get our business. There will be total of three letter types. Which are divided into Initial Invitation - consist of two types and a Reminder Letter - consist of one type. See below.
		</p>

		<p class="card-text">Initial Invitation letter - This is where the clients will get the first round of letters. There will be two letter types. For letter rules see below.
		<P>
		<p class="card-text">1.	Invitation letter = All the clients that are between the age of 51 to 74 years will get an invitation letter to register the program. This will be targeting to a specific area by postcode. For example Invitation letter target is between postcodes 4000 to 4089 which is QLD postcode.
		<P>
		<p class="card-text">2.	50th Birthday Invitation = Special 50th Birthday letter invitation where all clients turned 50 will get the invitation letter same as before can be targeted using specific area such as using different postcode.
		<P>
		<p class="card-text">Reminder Letter: The clients will get a second round of letters just in case they missed the first round of letters. There will be one reminder letter type, Letter rule see below
		<P>
		<p class="card-text">1.	Supplementary Letter after 24 days clients get a reminder letter.
		<p>
		<H5>Business Rule </H5>
		<p>Letter job runs every day at 12am picking up new clients
		<P>
		<P>
		Exception rule: Clients have already have prostate are not eligible to enrol in the program.
		<P>
		<P>
		<H5>
		Once the client are registered in the program.
		Business Rule  for Existing Client:
		</h5>
		<P>
		1.	If the client is 50 plus years old and don’t have any family history of cancer and the test outcome comes negative they will get a status of Well Men 2 which means retest in two years time
		</p>
		<p>
		2.	If the client is 50 plus years old and have family history of cancer and the test outcome is negative they will get a status of Well Men 1 which means they will get the reminder letter every one year
		</P>
		<p>
		Exception rule: Clients don’t want to be part the program they get a suspension status which will stop the system to send the letters out. 
		The letters will continue till there is positive result found where the clients now have to go through a treatment pathway with their local hospital services. Again I am not a clinical this is just an indication and kind of IT innovation on how systems will process.
		</p>
		<h4 class="card-title">Technologies</h4>
        <p class="card-text">The initial invitation letters we will need data this data will be coming from stakeholders such as Electoral Commission. When data from Electoral commission are received and the files are entered in our system, then system will need a data matching tool that will match our current data from the incoming data. Depending on the scale of the database as there are a few million men in Australia and will fall in our target rule Apex oracle database system will suit best and will have the ability to work with multiple browsers and mobile devices as well. Tools like SQL can be used to form and maintain tables for the database backend. QC can use for the administration side of the application. Different environments will be need for development, testing and production.
         </P>
         <h4 class="card-title">Skills Required </h4>
        <p class="card-text">Skills in developing a database system using Apex oracle. Creating forms and reports backend using SQL developer. Knowledge of how to run or process the letter jobs for the nivation letters. Data matching skills. Testing skills also plays a huge part in the project. Working in a team and working with stakeholders. Finding the skills and the hardware for this project should not be a problem as there are similar database that are currently running and can get assistance if required.
        </p>
        <h4 class="card-title">Outcome </h4>
        <p class="card-text">The outcome from this project will make a huge impact in saving lives. Many studies have suggested that if the cancer is detected at the early stage there is more chance of survival. The original problem can be solved by making all doctors mandatory to send their client the reminder letter, also there might be few doctors that are already using this practice now. The major road block for this project will be getting the data from Electoral Commission.
