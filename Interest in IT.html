        <p class="card-text">I'm interested in IT because I'm extremely interested in learning and excelling at new technologies. I've mastered some programs and languages in my current job as a Tester and want to expend my knowledge in IT and I look forward to mastering more programs as they're developed. I'm also interested in creative problem solving and developing large Application systems. My interest in IT started when I started working in a large organisation in system team. I have many interesting developers that I work with on a day to day basis. Looking at their skills in development has inspired me to study further in IT.
